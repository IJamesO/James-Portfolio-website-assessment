    <h3>Business Intelligence Dashboard</h3>
    <img src="dashboard-icon.jpg" alt="Dashboard Project">
    <p>As the developer, i came up with an interactive Power Bi dashboard using different tables and charts to visualize business performance metrics, improving data-driven decision making.
      Through my solution, the dashboard gave a clearer overview on how to read and utilise the data more efficiently.

  <h2 class="center-text">Problem-Solving Page – Design Concept</h2>

  <div class="concept-container">
    <p>
      The Problem-Solving Page was designed to simulate a realistic digital transformation solution 
      for a restaurant business. Its structure guides the user through a clear journey, beginning 
      with the business context, followed by a visually engaging menu display, and concluding with 
      an interactive reservation form.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Purpose & Structure</h3>
    <p>
      The layout mirrors modern restaurant websites by presenting context, services, and interactive 
      tools in a logical order. The menu section uses visual card layouts to resemble digital ordering 
      systems, while the booking form represents a functional reservation interface.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Visual & UX Design Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Consistency, readability, and accessibility guided the design theme. A dark background combined 
      with bright highlight colours improves contrast and visual focus. All components maintain spacing 
      and styling consistent with the rest of the portfolio for a unified experience.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Interactive Components</h3>
    <p>
      Hover effects, image-based menu cards, scroll reveal animations, and form validation demonstrate 
      practical user-experience features. These mimic real digital platforms and reinforce the concept 
      of interactive transformation in hospitality.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Real-World Applicability</h3>
    <p>
      The page models how restaurants use digital tools to improve customer engagement, highlight 
      products, and streamline operations. By integrating dynamic visuals and functional components, 
      the design shows an understanding of how technology enhances business processes.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Why This Design Works</h3>
    <p>
      The combination of structured content, strong UX principles, and interactive behaviour results 
      in a professional digital solution. It aligns with industry standards and satisfies the brief’s 
      emphasis on innovation, technology usage, and user-focused design.
